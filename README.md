# Hosting an Angular App on GitHub Pages

## Introduction

GitHub Pages offers a free and easy way to host Angular applications directly from your GitHub repository. It's ideal for developers looking to deploy single-page applications (SPAs) without the need for complex server setups.

## Prerequisites

1. **Angular Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Angular and Angular CLI.
2. **GitHub Account**: Required to create repositories.
3. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure both are installed.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create Your Angular App

- Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Create a new Angular app: `ng new <app-name>`
- Serve locally: `ng serve --open`

### 2. Set Up GitHub Repository

- Create a GitHub repository, ideally named `<username>.github.io` for root domain hosting.
- Add the GitHub repository as a remote: 
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git
  git push -u origin master
  ```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Add GitHub Pages deployment support: 
  ```bash
  ng add angular-cli-ghpages
  ```
- Deploy your app: 
  ```bash
  ng deploy --base-href=/<repositoryname>/
  ```

## Limitations

GitHub Pages is best for static sites and has limitations like a 1GB size limit, 100GB/month bandwidth, and 10-minute deployment time. It's not suitable for dynamic or large-scale applications but works well for small projects, documentation, and personal sites.

## Conclusion

GitHub Pages is an excellent option for hosting Angular SPAs, offering simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and integration with GitHub workflows.
